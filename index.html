                    <h5 class="content-center"><strong>DHT based</strong></h5>
                    <p>Instead of trying to repair or improve the traditional blockchain architecture to solve the performance bottleneck and other problems, we are going to fundamentally change the design concepts of traditional blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The team has carefully studied DAG, DHT and other technologies that could completely change the traditional blockchain.  <br>Finally, we choose the DHT based technology architecture considering that only DHT technology can achieve this without undermining decentralization, which can greatly improve the operational efficiency of the system and have all of the features of the traditional blockchain and even more.</p>
                </div>

                    </div>
                    <h5 class="content-center"><strong>Data safety & secure node</strong></h5>
                    <p>DHT technology itself has data loss prevention and backup mechanism. This mechanism has been successfully running in many decentralized systems for many years, such as Ceph and BitTorrent, which actually not only achieved data security theoretically, but also can scrutinize by time. <br>
                    But as designers of the system, we always need to consider the worst case, even though we know it's almost impossible. Therefore, we design 100 security nodes on the basis of DHT to deal with the worst case. Once the data in DHT is incomplete due to some factors, it will be synchronized from the security node in real time.</p>

                    <h5 class="content-center"><strong>Anchor & anonymous network & relay node</strong></h5>
                    <p>Traditional and already-worked anonymous networks are Tor, i2P, etc., which are time-tested and can achieve certain anonymity. However, there are also many problems. Tor and i2p have been proved to be unable to achieve 100% anonymity. Minor operational errors will result in information leakage. Meanwhile, the using process is very complicated.<br>
                    Therefore, we launched the anchor project, focusing on anonymity and ease of use, improving anonymity while simplifying the use for ordinary users.  </p>

                    <h5 class="content-center"><strong>Regulation & double secret key</strong></h5>
                    <p>The double-key mechanism means that there are two keys for each account. The key with all the functions is called the operation key. By all functions here, they not only include initiating a transaction, signing the transaction, but also checking account status at any time. The other key called review key only has the function of querying account status.<br>
                        In this case, if users choose to be supervised, users will give the review key to the regulatory authorities of the government so that the supervision department can check the status and changes of the account in real time.  </p>

                    <p>Privacy has always been a serious issue for blockchain practitioners because there is really no good solution. After comparing the broadcast protocol and zero-knowledge proofs, we believe that zero-knowledge proof serves as a good solution. Zcash adopted zero-knowledge for the first time in the field of digital currency. EDC has told us many times how excited he was the night when Zcash broke through 5BTC. Privacy is never the need for just a small number of people.</p>

                    <h5 class="content-center"><strong>BUT vs IPST & parallel double coin currency system</strong></h5>
                    <p>The basic function of the currency is transaction medium and value scale, while the basic function of assets is to maintain and increase value. <br>
                   We designed a parallel dual-currency economic system, stable currency BUT and digital asset IPST. This value stability is achieved through a transparent issuance and destruction mechanism to strictly control the currency supply. There is no difference between IPST and the ordinary digital currency.  </p>

                    <h5>Someone argues that the so-called decentralization of blockchain is nothing more than a new center, which is recognized by the Edison. However, the new center is an open, transparent, technology-supported center for all participants. Currently, it is still a pyramid structure, of which the top layer is a new center with technology as the core. The new pyramid is built from the bottom to up. The will of the lower level determines the shape and composition of the top. On the contrary, the traditional pyramid is a top-down one, the top level of which determines the form of the lower layer. At the same time, the new pyramid is completely created by code and performed by machines. Because the code is law, the code is always rational and the real rule of law. On the contrary, the traditional pyramid depends on the rule of people at every level, which inevitably leads to the problem of corruption because of human nature. However, the code will never be corruptive, but only keep running in accordance with established logic. </h5>

Because the basic function of the currency is to serve as the transaction medium and value scale, while the basic function of assets is to maintain and increase value. People need assets as well as currency in their daily lives. We believe that the system can only be pushed forward with decentralized system currencies and assets as gas together to push the system continuously forward. However, the underlying economic logic of currency and assets is completely different and must be issued separately. <br>
The historical evolution of gold to credit currencies, correspondingly to the digital currency, The digital assets such as Bitcoin will inevitably transfer the functions of the transaction medium by a new global digital currency with stable and adjustable supply, only retaining the digital assets attributes, as well as the the hard currency function in critical time.

                    <h5>Content creators</h5>
                    <p>The centralized content platform controls a significant internet traffic, manipulating the content of the users based on its own interests rather than the quality of the content itself. The quality here is a comprehensive consideration of the value of the content itself and user demands. At the same time, the centralized content platform can always arbitrarily delete and modify the content of the creator from its own position. It will be hard for the creator to have 100% control of the content once it is written and published on the Internet. <!--In some countries that have no freedom of speech, all the speech of the public needs to be in the position of some minority. Meanwhile, all the statements are supervised, censored, controlled, modified, and deleted. A decentralized content platform will always be neutral, giving users maximum freedom.<br>At the same time, in the traditional centralized content platform, high-quality content creators cannot directly monetize high-quality works. It often needs free value output first, waiting for fans to accumulate to a certain extent and then realizing the flow through e-commerce or advertising. Unfortunately, there are many specialists in one field but few all-rounders in the world.--></p>

                    <h5>Game</h5>
                    <p>In the traditional centralized gaming platform, ordinary users only have the right to use the virtual property, not ownership. It is very common that the user account is frozen and deleted by the game developer. All the virtual properties in the decentralized game platform is protected by the asymmetric encryption algorithm. The private key represents the sole ownership and usage right of the virtual property in the game. Thus, it can be assumed that players can really have everything in the game for the first time.  <!-- <br>At the same time, in traditional games, the transaction and conversion of virtual assets in different games is a serious problem because the centralization of the system will inevitably cause data isolation between different game systems. The liquidity only has solid state mobility, while the virtual property in the decentralized game based on the blockchain has a gaseous liquidity.
For those traditional game developers, it is the flow distribution and channel rather than the game itself that is more important. Decentralized game system has a very strong bootstrap. Only reducing the intermediate link and returning to the quality of the game itself will make the whole game industry enter a virtuous cycle.--></p>

                    <h5>Shared computing</h5>
                    <p>The era of big data has already come. To mine gold from data, corresponding centralized calculation support is necessary. The Cloud Center, Hadoop cluster, and Spark cluster are very expensive. In light of this, it is not worthwhile for users to build their own cluster who have no continuous demand for power but just deal with large numbers of computing tasks in short time. <!--It is difficult to ensure the security of the data through the use of cloud service vendors' computing services.--> The decentralized power-sharing platform can just fill in the blanks to not only reduce the calculation cost but also ensure the security of the data.<!-- <br>The new generation of fog computing platform with incentive mechanism
will undoubtedly be a strong competitor for AWS and Alicloud. Besides, it is
superior to the centralized cloud computing platform in terms of cost,
efficiency and data security. Confidentiality and security of data are the greatest
advantages of decentralized computing platform and also are viewed as the highest risks of the centering cloud computing platform. In the foreseeable future, decentralized fog computing platforms will become mainstream.-->

However, in the era of value Internet, we can have unique ownership of all virtual assets. Through asymmetric encryption algorithms, such kind of ownership is protected. The private key is the only certificate for ownership and use rights. The virtual economy supported by value internet will fully grow into a brand-new empire.</p>

                    <p>Decentralized data storage is not suitable to adopt blockchain solutions because the cost of data storage is too high. IPS DHT-based data storage services make data decentralized and anti-censorship and meanwhile have high security and low redundancy.<br>The biggest advantage of decentralization is the anti-censorship of data storage. Without a center, there will be no mandatory control.</p>
